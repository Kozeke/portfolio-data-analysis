      <h3>Project 1: Visualizing the COVID-19 Data for the Asia</h3> <img width="8%" src="images/favicon3.ico" alt=""></span>
      <h4>Stack:Python, d3.js</h4>
      <p>Visualizing the impact of Covid-19 in Asian Countries. Used charts: pie charts, buble chart, line chart, scatter plot, choropleth map, stacked bar chart</p>
      <h4>Usefull Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
<li>
Insights reveal that Georgia and Armenia experienced a higher death rate compared to other countries, with lower vaccination rates, GDP, and hospital beds.
</li>
<li>Age and COVID-19 Correlation:

A scatter plot analyzes the correlation between the share of the population aged 65 and older and the share of the population with confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Generally, there is a positive correlation, suggesting that countries with older populations tend to have fewer confirmed cases.
Some outliers, like Brunei and Bahrain, deviate from this trend.</li>
<li>Impact of Vaccination on COVID-19 Spread:

A choropleth map compares the number of deaths and vaccine rollout in different countries.
High-GDP countries with more vaccines show lower COVID-19 cases.</li>
Lockdown Measures and Stringency Index:
<li>
A choropleth map uses a stringency index to depict the impact of government-imposed lockdown measures in Asian countries.
The stringency index is based on metrics such as school closures, workplace closures, and travel restrictions.</li>
<li>Case Fatality Rate (CFR) Analysis:

CFR is explored over different periods, noting fluctuations during the initial, third, and fifth waves.
In the initial and fifth waves, GDP does not significantly affect CFR, but there is some correlation in other waves.
Human development index and the availability of hospital beds impact CFR in later periods.</li>
